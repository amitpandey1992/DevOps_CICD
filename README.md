### 1. Git Checkout
- Fetches the source code from the Git repository.
- Requires a valid Git credential (`git-cred`).

```sh
git clone -b main https://github.com/amitpandey1992/DevOps_CICD.git
```

### 2. Compile
- Compiles the source code using Maven.

```sh
mvn compile
```

### 3. Test
- Runs unit tests using Maven.

```sh
mvn test
```

### 4. File System Scan
- Scans the file system using Trivy for vulnerabilities.

```sh
trivy fs --format table -o trivy-fs-report.html .
```

### 5. SonarQube Analysis
- Performs static code analysis using SonarQube.
- Requires SonarQube scanner configured as `sonar`.

```sh
sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectName=BoardGame -Dsonar.projectKey=BoardGame -Dsonar.java.binaries=.
```

### 6. Quality Gate Check
- Waits for SonarQube quality gate results.

```sh
waitForQualityGate abortPipeline: false, credentialsId: 'sonar-token'
```

### 7. Build
- Packages the application using Maven.

```sh
mvn package
```

### 8. Publish to Nexus
- Deploys the artifact to Nexus repository.
- Requires Nexus credentials (`global-settings`).

```sh
mvn deploy
```

### 9. Build & Tag Docker Image
- Builds a Docker image from the application.
- Tags the image for DockerHub.
- Requires Docker credentials (`docker-cred`).

```sh
docker build -t amitpandey18/boardshack:latest .
```

### 10. Docker Image Scan
- Scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities using Trivy.

```sh
trivy image --format table -o trivy-image-report.html amitpandey18/boardshack:latest
```

### 11. Push Docker Image
- Pushes the Docker image to DockerHub.

```sh
docker push amitpandey18/boardshack:latest
```

### 12. Deploy to AWS EKS
- Deploys the application to an Amazon EKS cluster.
- Requires AWS credentials (`aws-eks-credentials`).

```sh
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name boardgame-cluster --region us-east-1
kubectl apply -f deployment-service.yaml
```

## Conclusion
This Jenkins pipeline automates the CI/CD workflow for a Java application, ensuring smooth code integration, testing, security checks, artifact management, and deployment to AWS EKS. By integrating quality gates and security scanning, it enhances application reliability before deployment.
# BoardgameListingWebApp

## Description

**Board Game Database Full-Stack Web Application.**
This web application displays lists of board games and their reviews. While anyone can view the board game lists and reviews, they are required to log in to add/ edit the board games and their reviews. The 'users' have the authority to add board games to the list and add reviews, and the 'managers' have the authority to edit/ delete the reviews on top of the authorities of users.  

## Technologies

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Amazon Web Services(AWS) EC2
- Thymeleaf
- Thymeleaf Fragments
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Spring MVC
- JDBC
- H2 Database Engine (In-memory)
- JUnit test framework
- Spring Security
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Maven

## Features

- Full-Stack Application
- UI components created with Thymeleaf and styled with Twitter Bootstrap
- Authentication and authorization using Spring Security
  - Authentication by allowing the users to authenticate with a username and password
  - Authorization by granting different permissions based on the roles (non-members, users, and managers)
- Different roles (non-members, users, and managers) with varying levels of permissions
  - Non-members only can see the boardgame lists and reviews
  - Users can add board games and write reviews
  - Managers can edit and delete the reviews
- Deployed the application on AWS EC2
- JUnit test framework for unit testing
- Spring MVC best practices to segregate views, controllers, and database packages
- JDBC for database connectivity and interaction
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data in the database
- Schema.sql file to customize the schema and input initial data
- Thymeleaf Fragments to reduce redundancy of repeating HTML elements (head, footer, navigation)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your IDE of choice
3. Run the application
4. To use initial user data, use the following credentials.
  - username: bugs    |     password: bunny (user role)
  - username: daffy   |     password: duck  (manager role)
5. You can also sign-up as a new user and customize your role to play with the application! ðŸ˜Š

Deploying a Dockerized Application to Amazon EKS
Prerequisites
Before deploying your Dockerized application to Amazon EKS, ensure you have:

An AWS account with the necessary permissions.
AWS CLI installed and configured (aws configure).
kubectl installed to interact with the EKS cluster.
eksctl installed for easy cluster management.
Docker installed for building and pushing images.
Helm installed (optional, for managing deployments).
Step 1: Create an EKS Cluster
Use eksctl to create a new EKS cluster:

eksctl create cluster --name boardgame-cluster --region us-east-1 --nodegroup-name standard-workers --node-type t3.medium --nodes 2 --nodes-min 1 --nodes-max 3 --managed
Verify the cluster is running:

aws eks update-kubeconfig --name boardgame-cluster --region us-east-1
kubectl get nodes
Step 2: Build and Push Docker Image to Amazon ECR
1. Create an ECR Repository
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name boardshack --region us-east-1
2. Authenticate Docker to AWS ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
3. Build and Push Image
docker build -t boardshack:latest .
docker tag boardshack:latest <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/boardshack:latest
docker push <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/boardshack:latest
Step 3: Deploy Application to EKS
1. Create a Kubernetes Deployment YAML file (deployment.yaml)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: boardshack-app
  labels:
    app: boardshack
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: boardshack
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: boardshack
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: boardshack
          image: <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/boardshack:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
Apply the deployment:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
2. Create a Kubernetes Service YAML file (service.yaml)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: boardshack-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: boardshack
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
Apply the service:

kubectl apply -f service.yaml
Check if the service has an external IP:

kubectl get svc
Once an external IP is assigned, access your application via:

http://<EXTERNAL-IP>
Step 4: Monitor and Scale Application
1. Check Pod and Service Status
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
kubectl describe svc boardshack-service
2. Scale the Deployment
Increase replicas:

kubectl scale deployment boardshack-app --replicas=3
Verify scaling:

kubectl get pods
Step 5: Clean Up Resources
To delete the deployment and service:

kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f service.yaml
To delete the EKS cluster:

eksctl delete cluster --name boardgame-cluster
Conclusion
This guide provides a step-by-step process to deploy a Dockerized application to Amazon EKS, including setting up the cluster, pushing the Docker image to ECR, deploying it on EKS, and exposing it using a LoadBalancer service.
